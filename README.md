# Melbourne-Real-Estate-Analytics

We all know how crazy real estate market is in Australia. Melbourne real estate is BOOMING. In this project, we will be analysing the real estate data of one of Melbourne.

# ProjectOverview:
In this data-driven adventure, I have explored Melbourne's real estate trends, unraveling key insights using the power of Azure Databricks. From predicting the top metropolitan regions to identifying the top suburbs, this project is aimed to unveil the analysis done on the property market of one of the major cities of Australia.

# Azure Services Used:
1. Azure Databricks: Collaborative analytics for data exploration using PySpark and SQL
2. Azure Blob Storage : Efficiently managing and storing massive datasets.

# Observations
1. Created a dataframe to filter data based on the combination of Suburb, Property Type and Bedrooms by using the widget utility of databricks.
2. Identified regions of Melbourne including metropolitan and non-metropolitan and their average prices.
3. Found the top 10 most expensive and cheapest suburbs in Melbourne based on the data that we have. From Toorak to Malvern, the affluence reflected in the soaring property prices
4. Property prices correlation with distance from CBD. The spatial dynamics revealed that proximity to the CBD often correlated with the higher property values, showcasing the allure of city living.
5. Bathroom and Parking spaces for different suburbs.
